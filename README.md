## Notes

- Ignoring that components are "Server Components" by default in Next 13
- Queries using setTimeout() to simulate a slow network
- Replaced react-swiper with tailwind utility classes to achieve same behavior
- Did not implement Search Modal and Notification modal as they are contextual components, they depend a lot on your UX research in terms of how users expect your search bar to behave and what entities show up in the search results. With notifications, I had close to zero context so it would be meaningless to build UI without backing research or context.
